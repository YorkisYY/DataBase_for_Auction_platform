# Initialize Our Database #
Run CreateDB.php (using XAMPP etc.) to initialize our database, with only the database structure, and with no data inside.

**Warning**: Running this program would overwrite the original "Auction" database if it exists, so be careful to check it first. If you do not want to overwrite, change the creation code manually...

# Data Storage #
Export your database using XAMPP and upload.
Synchronize and Import the database from here (using XAMPP etc.).
